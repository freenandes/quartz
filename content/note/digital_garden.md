## My definition

A digital garden is the practice of writing for yourself and the web, publicly, and in the spirit of contributing to a collective knowledge system.

I believe this could be beneficial for the society. Shared information is at the root of internet creation and proliferation. In the same logic, sharing our thoughts transforms our minds and feeds collective information systems that will push forward better ideas and foundations for solutions.

## Benefits

Some of the benefits I extracted so far with this gardening:
- Added a strategic view on the way I absorb content.
- Commitment to the idea of making space for thinking.
