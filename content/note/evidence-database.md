From experience, I’m finding that, plenty of times, the issue with problem-solving, and how the “design world” absorbed that concept (probably will write more on this another day), is that there is lack of proper communication of why we shaped a given solution.

I feel like we can almost assume that all issues arise, and blockers to innovation appear, out of inadequate communication of the problems we are solving and improper convincing on how betting on the solution at hands is, in fact, targeted to real issues and problems the business needs to suppress.

Businesses are naturally anxious and constantly debating on the risks and can’t see any connection to solution proposals. The result of that is often inaction, while competitors take the plunge and win, leaving the rest of the market far behind. I guess that is a natural outcome of capitalism, one strives while others sink.

One glimpse I had recently is that my focus on a simplified communication system of evidence does seem to be fruitful.

When presenting evidence from a user research case, I present the crux of what anyone needs to know to move forward to contemplating the recommendations or the solution.

Not easy. Digesting and synthesizing information from interviews takes time and effort. Especially if you are analyzing video interviews… However, “AI” came to the rescue this year. It’s at a level now that you can put AI to synthesize the information for you very fast with minimal hallucination, only requiring thorough review and very low additional writing.

Still, there is a problem, you can many times end up with a pile of information that is impossible for anyone to read and think progressively. Meaning, a person will read and will be so tired out of the density of information that it nullifies actionability and creates some sort of echoed analysis paralysis.

Create simple and short sentences for highly visual issues, like:

> People find it difficult to customize dashboards due to lack of visibility on the editing buttons.

Or sentences that encompass broader and more abstract issues:

> People find it difficult to find relevant information and decide on what to do due to an overwhelming number of visual information rendered to them.
