### Privacy Violations

AI can expose personal data.

Safeguards involve:
- avoiding sensitive data,
- using anonymized datasets,
- reviewing privacy policies,
- and adhering to data protection laws.

### Exploitation and Intellectual Property Concerns

AI use of creative works without compensation or permission.

Itâ€™s crucial to ensure:
- outputs comply with copyrights,
- provide proper attribution,
- and maintain transparency about the use of pre-existing content.

### Misinformation and Hallucinations

AI may generate incorrect or fabricated information, often based on outdated or biased training data.

To mitigate this:
- fact-check outputs,
- use models with updated data,
- and implement safeguards to detect and correct errors.

### Bias and Discrimination

Bias can emerge at various stages of the AI lifecycle, reinforcing stereotypes or marginalizing groups.

To reduce bias:
- craft inclusive prompts,
- use diverse training data,
- review outputs for fairness,
- and consider bias mitigation tools.
