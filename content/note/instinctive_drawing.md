Could we consider correcting a drawing, perfecting it, and retouching it to cheat the creative process? Could an excessively retouched drawing be a fake, an inaccurate representation of our idea? What comes first, even if as a goal, may just be the most representative form of what weâ€™re trying to achieve. We may be chewing our ideas too much. Or is the medium transformative, communicating both ways until the result pleases the artist?
