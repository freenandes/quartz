To help understand and use AI tools, IDEO suggests the “Scale of AI Utility” framework. This framework classifies AI tools into four categories:

- **Novel:** New capabilities that weren’t possible before.
- **Transformative:** Significant improvements in efficiency or quality.
- **Inspirational:** Provides ideas, though human input is still needed.
- **Unreliable:** Tasks where AI still doesn’t match human skills.
