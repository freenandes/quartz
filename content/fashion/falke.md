I like the design and build quality of Falkeâ€™s socks. I am pleased with the performance, although these socks are pricier than most big fast fashion corporations, I wouldn't call them exactly #slow-fashion. One can find them in most shops around, and they're quite popular, probably high-selling.

## Tiago

Positive:
- Quality touch.
- Stretchy and sensible to
- Durable and resistant to wear signs.

Negative:
- Elastane and polyamide are terrible choices.

## Cool Kick

Positive:
- Very comfy.
- Extremely functional design.
- Healthy fit, as in they don't mark your feet.

Negative:
- Polyamide.
- They show signs of wear, and they tear as fast as any other regular socks in the market.

## Sensitive London

Positive:
- Fresh and comfortable to wear.
- Healthy fit without pressure.
- Slightly more resistant than regular socks found in the market.

Negative:
- Elastane and polyamide in them, although a reduced percentage than the rest of their catalog.
