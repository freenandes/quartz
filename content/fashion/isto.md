Isto is a Portuguese brand with an interesting view on the future of fashion, fully embracing the transparency of the production process as a core value.

## Classic T-shirt

Bought a few light-colored Classic design t-shirts.

Positives:
- Comfortable fabric. Appears to be durable.
- Quality, rigorous seam lines.
- Good fit and height for my body type.
- Fair price for the quality.

Negatives:
- The neck is slightly wide for my taste.
- The neck is also loose and weirdly finished near the shoulder seam causing a slight lifting off the skin.
- Sleeve design is slightly tight for my taste. I do like goofy, skater-like, loose sleeves, so my fault here. The photos are actually accurate on this point.

## Flannel Shirt

Got one of these in gray twill.

Positives:
- Soft and comfortable fabric.
- The fabric appears to be resistant and of high quality. Needs the washing test.

Negatives:
- A bit short to tuck in.

## Heavyweight T-shirt

Got a white one. Here are some positives:
- Heavy fabric that feels good, but not as good as the Classic version.
- Good shape and beautiful, classic sleeve design that is almost perfect for my body type.

However, on the negative side:
- Fabric could be more crease resistant. You can get sharp marks just by using it, making you wish you had an iron at hand to fix it.

## Heavyweight Sweatshirt

Got an undyed one. Probably the best sweatshirt I ever acquired. Almost perfect. The inside of the sweatshirt is very comfy, warm and quite breathable. The only negative I could point out is that the cuff should be a little more tightened.
