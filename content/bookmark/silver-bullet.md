I'm interested in this note-taking app I've bumped into, called [SilverBullet](https://silverbullet.md/).

I have this idea to explore and use it to:
- Capture fleeting notes,
- Create more personal notes, potentially related to tasks or chores,
- Create quick, generic annotations,
- Also replace Google Keep's residual functionality I have for it.

I want to make sure that:
- I can run on all of my devices,
- I can access it remotely,
- It's flawlessly sync-able with a backup solution.

So far, my best shot would be to buy a Raspberry Pi. Wait for version 5, so I can use it for other stuff more flexibly. And then host this app for my use anywhere.
