## Grape Iris

It’s just a wonderful ride through a mishmash of styles and, strangely, it all blends in very well. Doesn’t seem like a popular album as well. It’s one of those rarities I’m pretty happy to add to a #party_playlist.

LP cover:

![Background is a very grainy photo with diffused subjects. I can't perceive what it is. Has the band's name at the top in a futuristic style and the name of the album at the bottom with a somehow groovy font style reminiscent of the sixties flower power.](../attachment/vsc-paste/d-day-240118093824.png)

Back cover:

![The background is a night photo of the band elements standing in the middle of a field as if they're talking between them. At the bottom, the album's tracklist and some credits.](../attachment/vsc-paste/d-day-240118093840.png)
