## Self-titled

Dirty, grainy, reverberated guitars. Just how I like it. Channeling some Jesus and Mary Chain. All tracks are go. The Suede cover is excellent. The ambient tracks are a delight.

###### LP cover

I prefer the packaging of this LP over the other version I’ve found on Discogs. The photos and the band’s name bind very well, looking a bit eerie.

## In search of spaces

###### CD cover

![Photo of a rudimentary stone archway, potentially medieval, with a cross engraving on the top middle of the arch. The photo is in black and white, printed on a brownish cardboard, making it look rugged, mysterious and eerie](../attachment/image/flying_saucer_attack-1700153261777.jpeg)

## P.A. Blues

Raw and intense clashing. I like how it turned into this dirtier, kraut-ish, radical style.

###### CD cover

![Extremely blurry photo of a clear sky, probably provoked by the enlargement beyond its resolution until you can actually see the printing, dotted pattern](../attachment/vsc-paste/flying_saucer_attack-231120155206.png)

## Distance

Fuzzy and warming. I like the mood this album puts on. It’s like I’m transported to a different dimension without the cheesy hippie stuff, just dreamy noise clouds that elevate you elsewhere to be inspired. Very creative sonic scapes.
