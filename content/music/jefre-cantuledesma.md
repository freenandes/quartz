## Music from the Headlands Center For The Arts, volumes 1 to 7

Like the experimental quality and how unexpected they sound. Great for work and to trance. Sometimes ethereal. Sometimes dirty and grainy, melancholic. Energetic, simple, surprising. A good layering to enjoy throughout.

I enjoy this type of uncompromised art, and it reminds me a lot how it should be most of the time: instinctive. My sole, humble opinion.

## A year with 13 moons

Listening to this is like being vacuumed sealed into a bag with all the summer noises that exist, and theyâ€™re all around your body, leaving an intense tingling sensation on the brain.

There is no apparent figuration formed from the strokes so it's an abstract painting.](../attachment/vsc-paste/jefre-cantu-ledesma-240325090008.png)

## In Summer

Sounds like a breath of warm air pushing your face with excellent harmonization. It also seems to have texture due to the graininess of the soundwaves. Excellent stuff.
