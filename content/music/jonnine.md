Similar sound to Jonnine’s band [HTRK](htrk.md).

## Super Natural

I appreciate that it feels somehow like a continuation of HTRK, since I enjoy that band. The voice is more cheery here, though, with an underlying need to detach from that HTRK inheritance.

A nice album that is calm and useful for dusk time.

## Blue Hills

I enjoy the subtle dissonances in this one, especially in the last track, “Let the waves roll”. Very useful for home office, creative sessions, and tranquil afternoons.
