## In orbit

Record with Matthew Lessner.

It’s loud, punchy and psychedelic while giving that warmth from the synths and guitar wah-wahs.

I just enjoy this a lot at any season, even though it sounds like it could be the perfect summery stoner. It depends. Sometimes 35º Celsius and this playing is too much, or it might be the cherry on top.
