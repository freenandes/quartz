I like almost every album. It just stays there in the room as ambient music. At times, it’s energetic, makes you dance, other times the samples inspire and lets you focus on your tasks.

Occasionally, you get to think about the saddening conflicts due to some political sampling… It is a crushing reality and potentially depressing…

> It is music. Music with serious political facts behind it. There are no lyrics because that would be preaching. It is music. It is up to you, to find out more. If you don’t want that, it is up to you. You can listen to only the music, or you can preoccupy yourself more with it.
