## Beat

[Album on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/master/21588-Bowery-Electric-Beat)

Excellent rhythm for my studio. Enticing drum rolls creep up my spine. Love the tempo and how it submits me to appreciate living at a slower pace but with cool.

The main cover’s simplicity is my design bread and butter. Love the title’s extended style of typography.
