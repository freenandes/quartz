Love the first albums of Ai, primarily:

- [Lavender](https://www.discogs.com/master/579139-Ai-Aso-Lavender-Edition)
- [Umerumonoizen](https://www.discogs.com/master/679504-Ai-Aso-Umerumonoizen)
  I enjoy the #lofi in this one. It’s beautiful and has some nice grooves.
- [Chamomile Pool](https://www.discogs.com/release/1053475-%E6%9C%9D%E7%94%9F%E6%84%9B-%E3%82%AB%E3%83%A2%E3%83%9F%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%81%AE%E3%83%97%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB-Chamomile-Pool)

They’re great for relaxing and filling the room with comfort. Don’t know what she’s singing, but a lot has to do with feelings of melancholy from dubious translations.

The acoustic values and instruments sparking, the melodies, and her voice are enough for me to enjoy it.
