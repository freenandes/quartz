[Album on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/master/21387-The-Ecstasy-Of-Saint-Theresa-Free-D-Original-Soundtrack)

Soothing and up my alley. It has a little bit of slow post-rock vibes and some lounge-y trance with pastoral sounds, like cows, chickens, birds… A bit of a weird mix, but it’s still very much enjoyable and somehow relaxing.

###### LP cover

Nice imagery on the LP.

![Same type of photo as the previous one, just a different details of the vegetaion, now with some blurred yellow flowers in the background](../attachment/vsc-paste/ecstasy_of_saint_theresa-231124170654.png)

###### CD cover

I like the humble typography work here.

![Same type of phot as the LP, close-up photos of vegetaiton. Now some purple cardoons are in highlight and focus. Band's name on the top area. Album's name on the bottom left and arranged in a circular design, like a stamp with another type of flower, red, as the background of said circle](../attachment/vsc-paste/ecstasy_of_saint_theresa-231124170908.png)
