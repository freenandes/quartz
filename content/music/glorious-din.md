## Closely Watched Trains

Itâ€™s a [Joy Division](joy-division.md) copycat. In the good sense?

I like listening to Joy Division, so this could be an extension I can look into to listen to more of that sound. At times, Glorious Din is very similar; other times, they sound like their thing.

I like how sometimes I can feel more of the acoustic quality in this record, but overall, it could have been better recorded and mixed, sounding very different from track to track.
